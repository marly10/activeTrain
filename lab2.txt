1.	(5 points) Why not use == to compare objects?
The == compares the location of objects, it sees if the two objects are pointing to the memory location and uses that to reference they are equal. 

2.	(5 points) How do you make .equals work to compare objects?

By comparing if the two objects have the same strings, int, doubles, etc. Creating an empty object and pointing it to the same memory location, after we’ve created a method that test for the same copy of objects. 
Also, by checking if the object being compared have are an exact copy. By using pointers, when we instantiate p1 and p2, we can point towards the memory in p1

3.	 (5 points) why does it not make sense for a static method to be able to use an instance class variable?
Because they are not apart of one object. Since we only have one copy of that static variable. 

4.	 (5 points) how is a static variable different from a non-static variable?
Non-static: single instance of the class, Static: Every instance of the class has access to it.
There is only one copy of a static variable, and several copies of a non-static variable.
